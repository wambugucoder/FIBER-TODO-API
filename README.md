# FIBER-TODO-API
A Todo Application written using golang and the fiber web framework


Fiber is a web framework that is very similar to Express, which makes it a perfect choice for any Node.js developer that decides to delve into the land of gophers. The framework is a well-designed wrapper around another framework - Fasthttp - which is considered to be one of the fastest web frameworks written in Go.
